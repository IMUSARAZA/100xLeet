# 100xLeet

Welcome to 100xLeet, a repository where I solve and document solutions for 100 LeetCode problems. The goal of this project is to improve problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding efficiency through consistent practice. Each solution includes well-documented code, explanations, and insights into the thought process behind solving the problems.

Key Features:
Solutions in Python
Optimized algorithms and alternative approaches
Detailed explanations and comments for each problem
Topics covered: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, and more
Reflection on problem-solving techniques and improvements
This repository will serve as a reflective journey through 100 coding challenges, providing valuable insights and resources for anyone looking to sharpen their coding skills.
